# Remarks
To access the frontend and backend, please change the directory to client and server,
running npm start on each.

Currently, due to technical difficulties, the frontend and backend are not integrated.
However, the functions for the backend are defined, and can be tested on localhost.

Feature of backend: From a postal code, it accesses the building details alongside the details of surrounding buildings via SQL queries.

Proposed Features of Frontend (Also reflected in comments in code and demo video):

Data Visualization of Buildings in Singapore

Selected building's features

Comments on its sustainability measures

Benchmarking of surrounding buildings around it (Also visualized in 3D using Verge3D)

Recommendations moving forward


3D Map of Singapore's buildings alongside their sustainability scores and efforts.
